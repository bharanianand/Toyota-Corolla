Part2 

Supervised Learning : 
Analysis of Toyota Corolla dataset for the prediction of the price using below the ensemble methods. 

Ensemble Methods :
1. Bagging with Decision Tree Regressor
2. Bagging with Support Vector Regressor

3. Pasting with Decision Tree Regressor
4. Pasting with Support Vector Regressor

5. AdaBoosting with Decision Tree Regressor
6. AdaBoosting with Support Vector Regressor

7. Gradient Boosting with Decision Tree Regressor
8. Gradient Boosting with Support Vector Regressor


Dimension Reduction : Applyting PCA to the dataset and calculating score post transformation on the models used in Part 1.
